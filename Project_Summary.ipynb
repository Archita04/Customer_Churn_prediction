    "At Sunbase, we prioritize understanding our customers and ensuring their satisfaction. To achieve this, we want to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn. Your task as a Machine Learning Intern is to work on this project, following the guidelines and responsibilities outlined in the job description.\n",
